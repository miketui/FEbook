# Professional EPUB Standards

## Semantic HTML5
Use appropriate tags for headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists, and sections to improve accessibility and navigation.

## Accessibility
- Provide `alt` text for all images.
- Use ARIA roles where necessary.
- Declare the document language with `lang` attributes.

## Metadata
Include comprehensive Dublin Core metadata in `content.opf` such as title, author, identifier, language, and publisher.

## Table of Contents
Create both an NCX and HTML navigation document for robust TOC support.

## Styling
Link a single CSS file for consistent typography and layout. Use media queries for responsive design if needed.

## Images and Media
Optimize image sizes and specify dimensions. Use fallback text for multimedia.

## Fonts
Embed font files referenced in CSS and ensure they are licensed for distribution.

## Validation
Run `epubcheck` to confirm compliance with EPUB 3.3 and address any reported issues.

## User Experience
Ensure clear chapter breaks, logical page flow, and easy navigation to enhance readability.
